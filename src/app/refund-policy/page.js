      `Clients of Deenita India Private Limited may request the cancellation of any service at any time. To initiate a cancellation, the client must submit a formal request in writing via email to support@7unique.in. Upon receiving the cancellation request, the Company will review the status of the service, assess the work completed, and evaluate any costs already incurred for third-party vendors, licensing fees, or operational expenses.  
      
      The Company reserves the right to deny cancellation requests if the service has been fully completed, delivered, or if cancellation violates contractual obligations agreed upon in the service agreement. Clients should understand that cancellation does not exempt them from fulfilling payment obligations for work that has already been completed or any expenses already incurred by the Company. This policy ensures fairness to both parties and protects the Company from financial loss due to cancellations made after significant work has been performed. Timely submission of a cancellation request is essential to determine eligibility for any potential refund.`,

      `All service fees charged by Deenita India Private Limited are generally non-refundable, unless explicitly stated in writing or required by applicable law. In cases where a service is only partially delivered and the cancellation request is approved, the Company may provide a pro-rata refund, calculated based on the proportion of work not yet completed relative to the total agreed scope of services.

Refunds, when applicable, will be processed through the same payment method originally used for the transaction. The processing timeline may vary depending on the payment channel and banking procedures but will be completed within a reasonable period after cancellation approval. This policy ensures transparency in financial dealings, clearly outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued, and sets clear expectations for clients regarding refund eligibility.

The refund structure protects both the client and the Company, ensuring clients are only charged for work performed while safeguarding the Company from losses due to partial cancellations.

      `Some services provided by Deenita India Private Limited involve third-party vendors, partners, or service providers, including banks, licensing authorities, utility providers, or other operational partners. Fees or costs paid to these entities are non-refundable regardless of whether the client cancels services.

Clients are responsible for all third-party charges, even if the Company has already incurred or remitted these payments before receiving the cancellation request. This ensures that the Company is not financially liable for expenses beyond its control. The policy also protects relationships with third-party vendors by guaranteeing timely payment and honoring contractual obligations with these providers.

Clients are advised to review all associated costs and obligations before requesting service initiation. Understanding these third-party obligations ensures transparency and prevents disputes regarding refund eligibility or service cancellations.

If an amicable resolution is not possible, the Company reserves the right to pursue legal action to recover unpaid fees, outstanding balances, or costs incurred as a result of service cancellations. This clause ensures that the Company maintains legal protection while providing a structured framework for dispute resolution.

It also emphasizes that clients are responsible for meeting payment obligations and understanding the cancellation and refund terms before engaging the Company’s services.

All requests should include sufficient details about the service, payment reference, and reason for cancellation to enable the Company to respond efficiently. Timely communication ensures proper assessment of the cancellation request and determination of any potential refunds.
Deenita India Private Limited aims to respond promptly to all requests, providing clear guidance regarding next steps and any applicable financial obligations. Unauthorized attempts to dispute payments or bypass the official process may result in legal action.
